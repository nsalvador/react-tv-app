			"Diabolical mastermind Harry Crowel, a.k.a. Prisoner 39013, escapes and, with a seemingly endless supply of henchmen, sets out to destroy all holdings of industrialist Horace Granville, who put him in prison. One target is an amusement park, home of the three Daredevils of the Red Circle, who perform death-defying stunts. Aghast at innocent lives lost, our three heroes swear to capture No. 39013. It'll be harder than they suspect; the villain is holding the real Granville captive, and with a near-perfect disguise, has taken his place!",

			'From the dirt tracks of America’s heartland to the bright lights of the country’s biggest speedways, American Daredevils brings to life the stories of the men who proudly carry the torch lit by Evel Knievel. These daredevils travel the country performing live, death-defying acts without the luxuries of rehearsals or second chances. They launch themselves through the air in cars and motorcycles, light themselves on fire, jump off tall buildings and risk their lives in countless crash-and-burn stunts, all for the freedom of making a living while doing what they love. They are the last of the daredevil breed, and as their lives unfold, it becomes clear that the stunts are only part of their stories.',
